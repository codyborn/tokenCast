# TokenCast NFT Art Display

## Android App

The Android App is great if you have a tablet or manufactured device that you'd like to turn into an NFT display. Keep in mind that the Android App is built to be installed on the display device, not the phone you're casting from. You can use [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download) as the mobile wallet if you don't have one already.

## Step 1 - Purchase an Android device

The app is compatible with a broad range of devices, from TVs to cell phones. A good candidate are these [IPS touchscreen tablets](https://www.amazon.com/Android-Touch-Screen-Processor-Bluetooth-Hyjoy/dp/B08T5Q282M) on Amazon.

## Step 2 - Setup

Install the TokenCast app via the [Android store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tokencast).

## Step 3 - Give us a review
